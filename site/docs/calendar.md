# The liturgical calendar

`src/lib/calendar/` derives every day of any year from the date of Easter and a
table of the Church's fixed celebrations, and `/calendarium` renders it. It is
the first thing on this site whose subject is not a text, and the first content
that is **ours** rather than reproduced.

## Why it is computed here

**The Holy See does not publish it.** _Mysterii Paschalis_ promulgated the
Universal Norms and the _Calendarium Romanum Generale_ together, and vatican.va
publishes the motu proprio and neither of the documents it approves — they are
printed in the Roman Missal. (The near misses, so nobody re-runs the search:
`liturgical_year/` is six descriptive pages with no dated list, and the
Congregation's _Notificazione_ gives norms for drawing up a _particular_
calendar.)

So the corpus could not hold this: there is no page to fetch, therefore nothing
for `raw/` to keep write-once, therefore no work. The table lives in this
repository as `grc.ts`, and `pontificates.ts` is the precedent — a fact about
the world that nothing upstream states, kept beside the code that needs it.

## An oracle is not a source, and the difference is the whole design

**A liturgical calendar is the one kind of output where being wrong looks
exactly like being right.** A mis-parsed encyclical is visible in its own text;
an Ordinary Time week numbered one too high is invisible until a reader who
knows the year notices. And the cases that break an implementation are chosen
for their rarity.

GCatholic publishes the calendar as iCal, per year, in the eight variants that
correspond exactly to the three transfers a conference may make.
`pipeline/scrapers/liturgical_calendar.py` fetches those to `raw/` and parses
them to `calendar/oracle/`, where `oracle.test.ts` compares every day of three
years, in every variant and every published national calendar, against what
this project computes.

**Nothing from the oracle is served to a reader.** It decides no day at
runtime; it decides whether the code that decides days is right. That is what
makes it an oracle in the corpus's own sense of the word, and why a scraper
that writes nothing to `build/` belongs in `pipeline/` at all.

**It earned its place before the first test ran**, finding two rules written
from the Norms that were wrong — the Octave of Easter is ranked as
_solemnities_ (n. 24), and reduction to a commemoration is not the Lenten thing
n. 14 describes. Four more came out of running it:

- **An optional memorial never takes the day.** Line 12 sits above line 13, so
  reading the Table as a plain sort makes every ferial Tuesday with a saint on
  it disappear into that saint — 100 days of 2026 alone. The Table ranks what
  happens when two celebrations _must_ be resolved.
- **A commemoration takes the season's colour, not the saint's**, being the
  weekday's own Mass with the saint's collect inside it.
- **The Saturday memorial of Our Lady is not offered on a Saturday that is
  already hers.**
- **The calendar is not a constant.** Newman was inscribed on 9 October between
  2025 and 2026, so a table with no dates in it quietly claims the calendar
  never changed. `SINCE` is the answer; a removal will want an `until`.

(The scraper is `liturgical_calendar.py` and not `calendar.py`, which it was
called for a day: a script's own directory leads `sys.path`, so every scraper
in the directory died on a circular import through `email` — and the shadowing
is silent when it does not crash, which is worse.)

## The engine

**Rank and precedence are separate fields.** The single most load-bearing
decision in the module. A feast of the Lord is line 5 and a feast of a saint is
line 7, with a Sunday in Ordinary Time between them at line 6, so the
Transfiguration displaces a Sunday and Saint Lawrence does not, though both are
`rank: 'feast'`. **Comparing on rank gets these backwards and reads plausibly
doing it.**

**An impeded solemnity does not always move forward.** n. 60 sends it to "the
closest day not listed under nn. 1–8", and _closest_ is not one direction: the
Annunciation goes forward past the Octave of Easter, Saint Joseph is
anticipated. 2035 needs both at once, because Easter falls on 25 March. The
direction is a property of the celebration and not a rule read off the season.

**A national calendar is a layer over the general one** — propers, rank
changes, transfers, and the general celebrations it keeps on another day —
because that is what nn. 48–55 describe. A country is a data file with no code,
and the general calendar cannot drift out from under it.

**Brazil's Sunday transfers are a table of years, because the rule turned out
not to exist.** Measured across three oracle years, Peter and Paul moved
_backward_ from a Monday in 2026 and _forward_ from a Tuesday in 2027, and All
Saints moved from a Monday and not from a Saturday: neither "nearest Sunday"
nor "following Sunday" fits all six. Outside the years listed the celebration
keeps its own date — the general calendar's answer, which is at least not a
date nobody chose. (The field is not `sundayTransfers`: only a solemnity is
transferred when impeded, and the Congo's Visitation moves to a Monday.)

**Seven extensions kept "a country is a data file" true**, each found by a
country failing rather than by reasoning:

- **There are four Sunday transfers, not three.** `General-{A..H}` is eight
  combinations of three, which reads as a statement that those are all — the
  Congo also keeps the Sacred Heart on the Sunday, and the Immaculate Heart
  does not follow it.
- **A celebration can fall on no date at all**: the Thursday after Pentecost,
  the third Sunday of January. Two forms cover all of them — an offset from
  Easter and an _n_th weekday of a month — and they are two rather than a
  vocabulary of named anchors because an offset is a fact anyone can check
  against a calendar.
- **A proper can be a feast OF THE LORD.** The module argued for an afternoon
  that a country never needs line 5, since n. 59 gives proper feasts line 8;
  the Santo Niño disproves it, since line 8 loses to a Sunday and the feast
  falls on one.
- **`elevations` had to be renamed `overrides`**, having only ever raised a
  rank while Brazil was the only layer. **A field named for the commonest case
  invites a reader to assume the rank can only go up.**
- **A conference changes its mind**, so `since` gates an override as well as a
  celebration.
- **Blue is a liturgical colour in two of these calendars** (Spain's
  _privilegio de azul_, inherited by the Philippines). **The obvious
  generalisation is false and worth recording as such**: it predicts the
  Spanish-speaking Americas, and five of them print 8 December in white.
- **Some days a calendar names are not celebrations** — Thanksgiving, Republic
  Day, Whit Monday as a Mass of the Holy Spirit. They carry **no rank**, and
  that is not an omission: they are not lines of the Table at all, and an
  invented rank would lose the one true thing about them.

**The rank tokens in these feeds are the language's own initials.** Nine
calendars in Latin and the Romance languages print `S F M m`, which reads as a
machine vocabulary; German prints `H F G g` and Polish `U Ś W w`. A table read
as language-independent was a coincidence of six feeds.

## Every calendar the source publishes

The list was the sixteen largest Catholic populations, on the reasoning that a
list has to stop somewhere. **What retired that is that the boundary was never
a limit**: a country costs one row in the scraper and one data file. The set is
now the one the source publishes — 86 calendars over 96 territories.

**Fifteen languages arrived at once and their rank tokens were READ rather than
written.** An unknown token is fatal in `parse_feed` precisely so a table of
guesses cannot pass, so they were derived by alignment: one calendar and year
in two languages is the same set of days, a day whose two editions each hold
exactly one unresolved token forces that pair, and iterating to a fixpoint
reaches all five ranks in all fifteen, unanimously. Two refute the rule the
first three suggested, spelling the optional memorial as a different word
rather than as a lowercase.

**Is this still computing or now copying?** Two parts. The temporal cycle, the
Table, transferred solemnities and `grc.ts` are computed here and judged by a
calendar someone else computed; that half is unchanged and is the half that can
be wrong invisibly. A conference's propers are not derivable from anything —
they are a positive act — and even the hand-written layers took their content
from the oracle. **So the kind of knowledge did not change when the
transcription went from hand to machine.** What changed is that the name check
for a derived country is now circular, and that hand transcription had been
silently correcting the source; the second is fixed by deriving from
`ACCEPTED_VARIANTS`, where this project already keeps every name it and
GCatholic spell differently. **Correcting the source where confidence is high
is the right act.**

**Only what the oracle agrees with is published.** `national/held.ts` names the
layers that still differ, with the measured count of diverging days out of
1,095 per calendar, and they are excluded from the picker — `unpublished.json`'s
argument for a different kind of output. The last test asserts the held list is
EXACTLY the diverging set, in both directions; without it a regressed layer
would be silently absorbed and a fixed one would sit unpublished for ever. The
recurring causes are things a layer cannot state: All Souls transferred off a
Sunday (a rule of `year.ts`), an observance suppressed by the day it falls on,
a conference that changed a transfer inside the oracle's window, and a patronal
solemnity on the LAST weekday of a month, which `MovableRule` cannot spell.

**A national proper's name is transcribed, and the check that remains is
real.** These celebrations have no Latin original, so the site carries the
conference's own wording and the oracle checks names in the anchor language
only. What it checks independently is everything the ENGINE does with them —
date, rank, colour, precedence, moves, suppressions.

## The page

**The date is a query parameter, not a path segment.** A reading address names
a citation and a chrome path names a page whose every word is the interface; a
date is neither, and as a chrome path it would put an unbounded set of URLs
into the sitemap for pages that are pure computation. The country joined it in
`?c=`, on the argument `?compare=` already makes: the address in front of the
reader should reproduce what they are looking at. `?c=general` is never
written, being an absence rather than a value.

**`replaceState` does not update `page.url`, and the controls did nothing** for
weeks, with no console error and nothing in `npm run check` or `npm test`.
Shallow routing sets `page.state` and deliberately never assigns `page.url`, so
a page deriving from `page.url.searchParams` had two ideas of where it was.
The fix is `goto(url, { replaceState, noScroll, keepFocus })`. **The general
lesson is about the failure's shape, not the API**: a control that reads
derived state and writes it through a different mechanism can be wrong in a way
that looks like nothing at all — the address bar agreed with the reader, which
is what made it possible to conclude the page was slow rather than broken.

**The country picker is a grid of flags.** The reader of that control is not
weighing alternatives, they are looking for their own country, which they
recognise by its flag faster than they can read a column of names in an
alphabet that may not be theirs — and a grid answers "which countries does this
site have?" by being opened. The flags are the two regional-indicator code
points of the ISO 3166-1 code the calendar is already keyed by: one offset, no
assets, no licence question. **The fallback is what makes that safe** — Windows
ships no flag glyphs, so Chrome draws the boxed letters `BR`, which is the
country's code and still names the cell. The general calendar is a labelled row
above the grid rather than a square in it, because it is the thing the others
are layers over.

## What it deliberately does not say

**The lectionary.** The cycle letters are stated as facts about the year and
the page stops there; the readings are a work this corpus does not hold, and
printing citations for them would assert a table nobody here has sourced.

**The day's colour as the page's colour.** Liturgical colours are vestment
colours, and four of them are also this interface's background in one theme or
another. A named swatch says the same thing without the page pretending to be
the sanctuary.

**Every language's saints.** The Calendarium is a Latin book, so the Latin name
is the celebration's own; English and Portuguese are written, each layer's
propers carry the language its conference approved them in, and everything else
falls through `CONTENT_LANG_FALLBACK` exactly as it does for a work the corpus
does not hold. A national proper has no Latin at all, and that is correct
rather than a gap — composing one would be invented text.
